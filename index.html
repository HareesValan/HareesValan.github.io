        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            Welcome! My name is Harees Tibursius Antony and this is my website made for Assignment 3 of COIS-2430: Web Development I: 
            Front-End.For this assignment, I made a website to talk about myself and my experiences at the university and how I navigate
            through my life.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a second year Computer Science student, I focus on balancing my studies and my personal projects. Specializing in Software
            engineering, I study from a specific and theoretical perspective while making sure I get my fair share of hands-on experience.
            With a 100% workload, I aspire to complete my degree in the coming two years and graduate into the working scene where I can
            gain far more experience than what I currently have.
        </p>
        <p>
            An average week for me would be attending my four classes, which are: COIS-2430H: Web Development I: Front-End,
            COIS-3050H: Formal Languages & Automata, COIS-3533H: Game Studies, and COIS-3560H: Human Computer Interaction.
            My fifth course, however, is the online course COIS-2750H: Computer Crime & Forensics. As an online course, there is often 
            nothing more than simple weekly discussions, quizes, and a final exam, giving me more leisure when it comes to my everyday
            schedule.
        </p>
        <p>
            Besides my classes, I often spend my time in the gym and in the library on a regular week day. I tend to spend my time in the
            library preparing for my classes and simply idling around and my time at the gym workout out my body for a better performance.
            Outside of the university, on weekends, I often tend to go back home every other week. As for the days I am in peterborough,
            I tend to hang out with my friends downtown or even on campus sometimes.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am currently in my second year pursuing a Bachelors degree in Computer Science. I plan on graduating in the next two years
            and eventually securing a job in the field. Personally, I am biased towards web development and/or cybersecurity. However, fate
            might drag me to the front of a McDonalds' cash register. This serves as honest motivation for myself and my fellow classmates
            to work harder. After all, it is always better to fail while trying than to not try at all.
